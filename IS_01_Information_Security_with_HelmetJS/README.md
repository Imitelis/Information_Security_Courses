## 1. Courses - Introduction to Information Security with HelmetJS Challenges

This is the boilerplate for the Information Security lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/

HelmetJS is a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers to prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client. While HelmetJS does not account for all situations, it does include support for common ones like Content Security Policy, XSS Filtering, and HTTP Strict Transport Security, among others. HelmetJS can be installed on an Express project from npm, after which each layer of protection can be configured to best fit the project.

Working on these challenges involves writing code on Replit in our starter project.

  *  Start by importing the project on Replit.
  *  Next, you will see a .replit window.
  *  Select Use run command and click the Done button.
  *  Complete each challenge and copy the public Replit URL (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it!

Optionally, you may write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.

Start this project on Replit using this link or clone this repository on GitHub! If you use Replit, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe!
